### Agenda

 

### Goals of session

Many science advances have been possible thanks to the use of research software, which has become essential to advancing virtually every Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discipline (and many non-STEM disciplines as well). And while much of it is made available under open source licenses, work is needed to develop, support, and sustain it, as underlying systems and software as well as user needs evolve. This panel will discuss challenges and solutions related to sustaining research software, and will collect examples of successes and failures from the audience that can and will be widely shared. This will enable advanced compute and data infrastructures to positively impact future research software and future research.

The aims of this session are:
