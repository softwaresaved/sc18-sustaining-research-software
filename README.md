### Goals of session

Many science advances have been possible thanks to the use of research software, which has become essential to advancing virtually every Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) discipline (and many non-STEM disciplines as well). And while much of it is made available under open source licenses, work is needed to develop, support, and sustain it, as underlying systems and software as well as user needs evolve. This panel will discuss challenges and solutions related to sustaining research software, and will collect examples of successes and failures from the audience that can and will be widely shared. This will enable advanced compute and data infrastructures to positively impact future research software and future research.


The aims of this session are to:
   1) highlight the tension between sustainability and performance, 
   2) gather ideas about solutions that have worked in specific contexts, and 
   3) bring them together for others to learn from

This will help steer SC community discussion toward understanding and addressing this issue and this tension.

As part of this session, we will be using interactive polling tools to get feedback from the audience on a number of key questions, which the panellists will discuss.
